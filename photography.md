  headline: Street Photography
  content: Street photography at its essence means candid photography of people and
    humanity. A street photograph has to be a real, unposed moment.<br><em><br>"For
    me, photography is not a means by which to create beautiful art, but a unique
    way of encountering genuine reality." </em><strong>Daido Moriyama<br><br></strong>“<em>In
    photography, the smallest thing can be a great subject. The little, human detail
    can become a Leitmotiv.”</em> <strong>Henri Cartier-Bresson</strong>

    ethics are established on the basis of the family, and this is one of the reasons
    why Chinese people have a heavier concept of family.</p></li><li><p>Hegel's ethics
    are not natural blood and emotional relations, but human and divine laws, including
    the state, civil society, and the family. The family is for the cultivation of
    independent citizens for civil society and the state, not the relationship of
    loyalty and filial piety, but the cultivation of rational personality.</p></li></ul>"

  headline: Photographer Gao Shan’s “The Eighth Day” Goes Deep on the Relationship
    with His Adopted Mother
  content: "“I grew up in a family that was not good at communicating or expressing
    emotion,” he says. “Questions, such as my mother’s experiences or my own are hazy
    for one another. I feel a sense of loss from this.”<br><br>The result is a compelling
    visual dialogue that wrestles with loss, pain and regret, as much as it embraces
    love, compassion and, ultimately, reconciliation.<br>"
