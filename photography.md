  headline: Street Photography
  content: Street photography at its essence means candid photography of people and
    humanity. A street photograph has to be a real, unposed moment.<br><em><br>"For
    me, photography is not a means by which to create beautiful art, but a unique
    way of encountering genuine reality." </em><strong>Daido Moriyama<br><br></strong>“<em>In
    photography, the smallest thing can be a great subject. The little, human detail
    can become a Leitmotiv.”</em> <strong>Henri Cartier-Bresson</strong>

  caption: Taking up the gauntlet laid down by the greats of twentieth-century street
    photography, Tatsuo Suzuki photographs with an urgency and dynamism that allows
    him to produce rambunctious street scenes interlaced with thoughtful character
    studies.
