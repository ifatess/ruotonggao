  headline: Street Photography
  content: Street photography at its essence means candid photography of people and
    humanity. A street photograph has to be a real, unposed moment.<br><em><br>"For
    me, photography is not a means by which to create beautiful art, but a unique
    way of encountering genuine reality." </em><strong>Daido Moriyama<br><br></strong>“<em>In
    photography, the smallest thing can be a great subject. The little, human detail
    can become a Leitmotiv.”</em> <strong>Henri Cartier-Bresson</strong>

  content: "<ul><li><p>The establishment of family relations.</p></li><li><p>Chinese
    ethics are established on the basis of the family, and this is one of the reasons
    why Chinese people have a heavier concept of family.</p></li><li><p>Hegel's ethics
    are not natural blood and emotional relations, but human and divine laws, including
    the state, civil society, and the family. The family is for the cultivation of
    independent citizens for civil society and the state, not the relationship of
    loyalty and filial piety, but the cultivation of rational personality.</p></li></ul>"
