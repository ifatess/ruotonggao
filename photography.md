  content: 'Street photography at its essence means candid photography of people and

    Moriyama: </strong><em>"For me, photography is not a means by which to create
    beautiful art, but a unique way of encountering genuine reality." </em><strong><br>Henri
    Cartier-Bresson: </strong>“<em>In photography, the smallest thing can be a great
    subject. The little, human detail can become a Leitmotiv.”</em> '

    are not natural blood and emotional relations, but human and divine laws, including
    the state, civil society, and the family. The family is for the cultivation of
    independent citizens for civil society and the state, not the relationship of
    loyalty and filial piety, but the cultivation of rational personality.</p></li></ul>"

    with His Adopted Mother
  content: "“I grew up in a family that was not good at communicating or expressing
    emotion,” he says. “Questions, such as my mother’s experiences or my own are hazy
    for one another. I feel a sense of loss from this.”<br><br>The result is a compelling
    visual dialogue that wrestles with loss, pain and regret, as much as it embraces
    love, compassion and, ultimately, reconciliation.<br>"
