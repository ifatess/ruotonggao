    with Fujitec Elevator Company to design elevator buttons in accordance with their
    cognitive habits by means of usability experiments.<br>Before the experiment,
    we collected and compiled relevant literature to gain some understanding of the
    interactive #features of the visually impaired.'

  headline: Background
  content: Globally, approximately 1.3 billion people are suffering from vision impairment.
    The number of elderly people with impaired vision, as well as young people with
    myopia, has increased dramatically. As the world's population increases, as well
    as rapid economic and technological development and urbanization, the proportion
    of high-rise buildings is gradually increasing worldwide, and elevators are an
    essential tool in the lives of millions of households.<br><br>However, people
    with impaired vision cannot accurately judge the elevator buttons when using elevators,
    which is a major pain point in the design of elevator operation panels.
