  content: "<strong>My Goal</strong><br>Although accessible technology such as screen
    readers and magnifiers are available to help the disabled to interact, the entertainment
    needs of people with disabilities, especially the visually impaired, are often
    overlooked. Many of the blind people I met do not have any entertainment activities
    other than listening to the radio, living life with boredom and depression. Therefore,
    game accessibility is considered a critical issue within the Human-computer interaction
    field and an issue that I endeavor to address.<br><br><strong><em>Pursued on My
    Own<br><br>Individual Work</em></strong>"
