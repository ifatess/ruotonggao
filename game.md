  headline: Introduction
  slug: "#intro"
  content: I designed this game out of my love for the novel <em>Do Androids Dream
    of Electric Sheep?</em> , as well as the cyberpunk style. I made an attempt at
    game design in this fashion, and transformed my favorite novel into playable media,
    where I can experience the role of both androids and humans in the virtual future.<br><br>This
    game is for 2-4 players. Players take on the role of one of the androids and humans
    (whose names inspired by the movie <em>Blade Runner</em>), collecting <em>Memory
    </em>as many as possible<em> </em>to win the game. In the game, players can gain
    <em>Electricity</em> or <em>Memory</em>, own or loot others' electric sheep and
    go to the <em>Rooftop</em> with them. To win the game, players need to judge the
    timing of decisions, cooperate with their teammates, and make full use of their
    character skills to gain victory.

  content: "<br><strong>How to create an engaging game interaction experience.<br></strong>This
    is the first game design I have done independently. From a gamer with extensive
    knowledge of games to a game designer, I need to consider not only the original
    intention of the design, but also its playability and more systematic design concepts.<br>This
    made me want to seek deeper development in the field of game design and experience.
