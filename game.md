  headline: Introduction
  slug: ''
  content: I designed this game out of my love for the novel <em>Do Androids Dream
    of Electric Sheep?</em> , as well as the cyberpunk style. I made an attempt at
    game design in this fashion, and transformed my favorite novel into playable media,
    where I can experience the role of both androids and humans in the virtual future.
